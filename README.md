# **LangChain-Agent**  

## **About the Project**  
This is a simple LangChain-based conversational agent that runs Mistral locally using Ollama. It can answer user queries and fetch real-time information from Wikipedia if required. It also supports basic arithmetic calculations without using the model.  

## **Setup Instructions**  

### **1. Install Ollama**  
First, you need Ollama to run the Mistral model locally. Download and install it from: [https://ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)  

### **2. Install Python Dependencies**  
Make sure you have Python 3.9+ installed. Then, install the required libraries using:  
```sh
pip install langchain langchain_community langchain_ollama
```  

### **3. Download the Mistral Model**  
Run this command to pull the Mistral model into Ollama:  
```sh
ollama pull mistral
```  

### **4. Check the model using**
```sh
ollama list
```

### **4. Run the Agent**  
Start the agent by running:  
```sh
python agent.py
```  

## **How It Works**  
- The agent accepts user queries.  
- If a query requires factual information, it searches Wikipedia.  
- If it's a general question, Mistral generates a response.   
- Type `exit` to quit.  

### **Example Queries:**  
```
> Who is Sunita Williams?
> What is the capital of Japan?
> exit
```

```

## **Notes**  
- This agent uses LangChain’s Conversational Agent framework.  
- The external tool used is Wikipedia for factual look-up.  
- Mistral is lightweight (4.1 GB) and works well for local LLM-based chat applications.

## Sample Outputs  
Here are example responses generated by the LangChain agent:  

### Example Query: Alan Turing  
**User Input:**  
Enter your query (or 'exit' to quit): Who is Alan Turing?

   Action: wikipedia
   Action Input: Alan Turing
   Observation: {Alan Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, and philosopher. He was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalization of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine. During World War II, he worked for the Government Code and Cipher School at Bletchley Park, Britain's code-breaking center. There, he was responsible for mathematics relating to German Enigma ciphers and helped develop early computers.}
