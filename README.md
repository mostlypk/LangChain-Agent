# **LangChain-Agent**  

## **About the Project**  
This is a simple LangChain-based conversational agent that runs Mistral locally using Ollama. It can answer user queries and fetch real-time information from Wikipedia if required. It also supports basic arithmetic calculations without using the model.  

## **Setup Instructions**  

### **1. Install Ollama**  
First, you need Ollama to run the Mistral model locally. Download and install it from: [https://ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)  

### **2. Install Python Dependencies**  
Make sure you have Python 3.9+ installed. Then, install the required libraries using:  
```sh
pip install langchain langchain_community langchain_ollama
```  

### **3. Download the Mistral Model**  
Run this command to pull the Mistral model into Ollama:  
```sh
ollama pull mistral
```  

### **4. Check the model using**
```sh
ollama list
```

### **4. Run the Agent**  
Start the agent by running:  
```sh
python agent.py
```  

## **How It Works**  
- The agent accepts user queries.  
- If a query requires factual information, it searches Wikipedia.  
- If it's a general question, Mistral generates a response.  
- If the input is a math expression (e.g., `12+5`), it calculates the result.  
- Type `exit` to quit.  

### **Example Queries:**  
```
> Who is Sunita Williams?
> What is the capital of Japan?
> 25*4
> exit
```

## **Notes**  
- This agent uses LangChain’s Conversational Agent framework.  
- The external tool used is Wikipedia for factual look-up.  
- Mistral is lightweight (4.1 GB) and works well for local LLM-based chat applications.

## Sample Outputs  
Here are example responses generated by the LangChain agent:  

### Example Query: Alan Turing  
**User Input:**  
Enter your query (or 'exit' to quit): Who is Alan Turing?

**Agent's Thought Process:**  
Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Thought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes Action: wikipedia Action Input: Alan Turing Observation: {Alan Turing was an English mathematician...} AI: Alan Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist....

**Final Answer:**  
Alan Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, and philosopher. He is best known for his work on the Turing machine, which provided a formalization of the concepts of algorithm and computation...

Additional Information: Instead of trying to save space, installing a better model serves better in the long run. Smaller modes have limitations.
